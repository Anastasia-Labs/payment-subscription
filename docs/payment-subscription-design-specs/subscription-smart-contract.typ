= Overview
\

This Payment Subscription Smart Contract is developed using Aiken it is designed to facilitate automated recurring payments between subscribers and merchants on the Cardano blockchain. This contract empowers users to seamlessly set up, manage, and cancel their subscriptions directly from their wallets. It ensures secure and efficient transactions by automating the process of paying subscription fees, updating service metadata, and handling cancellations, all within a decentralized framework.

)
\

There are three contracts in this subscription system.

+ *Service Contract* 
  
  A multi-validator responsible for creating an initial service by minting a single CIP-68 compliant Service NFT Asset and sending it to the user while sending the reference NFT to the spending endpoint. It also updates the metadata for the user and deletes the service by burning the Service NFT.

+ *Account Contract*
  
  A multi-validator responsible for creating an account for the user by minting a CIP-68 compliant Account NFT Asset and sending it to the user, while sending the reference NFT to the spending endpoint. It also updates the metadata for the Account and deletes the user account by burning a Account NFT.

+ *Payment Contract*
  
  This is the core validator. A multi-validator responsible for holding the prepaid subscription fees for a service, renewing a subscription to a service, unsubscribing from a service and withdrawing subscription fees. The contract incorporates a linear vesting mechanism to gradually release subscription fees to the merchant over the subscription period.
#pagebreak()

= Specification


== System Actors
\ 
+ *Merchant*
  
  - An entity who interacts with the *Service Contract* to create a service and receive subscription payments for the respective service(s). 
  
  - A user becomes a merchant when they mint a *Service NFT*.

+ *Subscriber*

  - An entity who interacts with the *Account Contract* to create an account and deposit prepaid subscription fees to the *Payment Contract*. 
  
  - A user becomes a subscriber when they mint an *Account NFT* and lock funds to the *Payment Contract*.
\
== Tokens
\
+ *Service NFT*

  - Can only be minted by a user when creating a service 
  
  - Burned when the user deletes their service(s) from the system.
  - *TokenName:* Defined in *Service Multi-validator* parameters using a unique token name derived from the transaction ID and output index (using CIP-68 standards).

+ *Account NFT:*

  - Can only be minted by a user when creating an account for the subscription system.

  - Burned when the user deletes their account from the system. 
  - A check must be included to verify that there are no payments in the Payment Contract before burning.
  - *TokenName:* Defined in *Account Multi-validator* parameters using a unique token name derived from the transaction ID and output index (using CIP-68 standards).

+ *Payment NFT:* 

  - Can only be minted when a subscription fee is paid to the *Payment Contract*

  - Burned when a merchant withdraws the Penalty Fee or Subscription ends.

  - *TokenName:* Defined in *Payment Multi-validator*  parameters using a unique token name derived from the transaction ID and output index.

== Smart Contracts
\
=== Payment Multi-validator
\
  The Payment Contract is responsible for managing the prepaid subscription fees, validating subscriptions, and ensuring the proper distribution of these fees over the subscription period given the `total_installments`. It facilitates the creation, extension, and cancellation of subscriptions, allowing both subscribers and merchants to interact with the contract in a secure and automated manner. This contract ensures that subscription payments are correctly handled and that any penalties for early cancellation are appropriately enforced.
