= Overview
\

This Payment Subscription Smart Contract is developed using Aiken to facilitate automated recurring payments between Subscribers and Merchants on the Cardano blockchain. This smart contract enables users to set up, manage, and cancel subscriptions directly from their wallets.

= Architecture

\
#figure(
  image("./images/payment-subscription-architecture.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [Payment Subscription Architecture],
)
\

There are three contracts in this subscription system.

- *Merchant Contract:* A multi-validator responsible for creating an initial service by minting a single CIP-68 compliant MerchantNFT and sending it to the merchant while sending the reference NFT to the spending end point. It also updates the metadata for the merchant and deletes the service by burning the MerchantNFT.

- *Subscriber Contract:* A multi-validator responsible for creating the initial subscription to a service by minting a SubscriberNFT and sending it to the user, while sending the reference NFT to the spending endpoint. It also updates the metadata for the subscriber and deletes the user account by burning a SubscriberNFT.

- *Payments Contract:* Responsible for holding the prepaid subscription fees for a service, renewing a subscription to a service, unsubscribing from a service and withdrawing subscription fees. The contract incorporates a linear vesting mechanism to gradually release subscription fees to the merchant over the subscription period. This could also be a multi-validator to authenticate the UTxO.

= Specification

== System Actors
\ 
- *Merchant:* An entity who interacts with the Merchant Contract in order to create a service and receives subscription payments for the respective service or services. A user becomes a merchant when they mint a Merchant NFT.

- *Subscriber:* An entity who interacts with the Subscriber Contract in order to create an account and deposit prepaid subscription fees to the Payments Contract. A user becomes a subscriber when they mint a Subscribe NFT.
\

== Tokens
\
- *Merchant NFT:* Can only be minted by a merchant when creating a subscription service and burned when merchant removes their service/services from the system. Datum is updated when a subscription is paid or the merchant withdraws from the Payments Contract.

 - TokenName: Defined in Merchant Multi-validator parameters with the hash of the Merchant Policy Id

- *Subscriber NFT:* Can only be minted when a subscription fee is paid to Payments Contract and burned when subscriber exits the system. Datum is updated when fees are deposited and withdrawn from Payments Contract.

 - TokenName: Defined in Subscriber Multi-validator parameters with hash of the Subscriber Policy Id
\

== Smart Contracts

=== Payments Validator
\
The Payments Contract is responsible for managing the prepaid subscription fees, validating subscriptions, and ensuring the proper distribution of these fees over the subscription period. It facilitates the creation, extension, and cancellation of subscriptions, allowing both subscribers and merchants to interact with the contract in a secure and automated manner. This contract ensures that subscription payments are correctly handled and that any penalties for early cancellation are appropriately enforced.

==== Parameters
\
- *`merchant_policy_id`* : Hash of the PolicyId
- *`subscriber_policy_id`* : Hash of the PolicyId

==== Datum

\
This is a Sum type datum where one represents the main datum and the other one represents a penalty datum.

===== Main datum
\
- *`merchant_nft_tn`:* Merchant's token name encoding UTxO to be consumed when minting the NFT.

- *`subscriber_nft_tn`:* Subscriber's token name encoding UTxO to be consumed when minting the NFT.
- *`subscription_fee`:* AssetClass type for the subscription fee.
- *`subscription_fee_qty`:* Amount of the subscription fee.
- *`subscription_start`:* Start of the subscription.
- *`subscription_end`:* Expiry time of the subscription.
- *`total_installments`:* The number of periodic intervals over which to release subscription fees.

===== Penalty datum
\
- *`merchant_nft_tn`:* Merchant's token name encoding UTxO to be consumed when minting the NFT.

==== Redeemer
\
- Extend

- Unsubscribe
- Withdraw

==== Validation
\
- *Extend:* The redeemer will allow anyone to increase the subscription funds. 

  - validate that the value of the UTxO is increased as long as the Datum is updated with the Merchant Token Name.

- *Unsubscribe:* The redeemer will allow anyone with a subscriberNFT to spend Subscribe UTxO to unlock funds back to their address.
 
  - validate the subscriberNFT is being spent.

  - validate that the penalty UTxO is being produced with the merchants Token Name.

- *Withdraw:* The redeemer will allow anyone with a merchantNFT to withdraw funds from the Payments contract 
 
  - validate merchantNFT is being spent

  - validate whether the transaction contains a penalty datum or a normal datum.
