= Overview
\

This Payment Subscription Smart Contract is developed using Aiken to facilitate automated recurring payments between Subscribers and Merchants on the Cardano blockchain. This smart contract enables users to set up, manage, and cancel subscriptions directly from their wallets.

= Architecture

\
#figure(
  image("./images/payment-subscription-architecture.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [Payment Subscription Architecture],
)
\

There are three contracts in this subscription system.

- *Service Contract:* A multi-validator responsible for creating an initial service by minting a single CIP-68 compliant Service NFT Asset and sending it to the user while sending the reference NFT to the spending end point. It also updates the metadata for the user and deletes the service by burning the MerchantNFT.

- *Account Contract:* A multi-validator responsible for creating an account for the user by minting a CIP-68 compliant Account NFT Asset and sending it to the user, while sending the reference NFT to the spending endpoint. It also updates the metadata for the Account and deletes the user account by burning a AccountNFT.

- *Payment Contract:* This is the core validator. A multi-validator responsible for holding the prepaid subscription fees for a service, renewing a subscription to a service, unsubscribing from a service and withdrawing subscription fees. The contract incorporates a linear vesting mechanism to gradually release subscription fees to the merchant over the subscription period.

= Specification

== System Actors
\ 
- *Merchant:* An entity who interacts with the Service Contract in order to create a service and receives subscription payments for the respective service or services. A user becomes a merchant when they mint a Service NFT.

- *Subscriber:* An entity who interacts with the Subscriber Contract in order to create an account and deposit prepaid subscription fees to the Payments Contract. A user becomes a subscriber when they mint an Account NFT and add lock funds to the Payment Contract.
\
== Tokens
\
- *Service NFT:* Can only be minted by a user when creating a service and burned when the user spends the deletes their service/services from the system.

 - TokenName: Defined in Service Multi-validator parameters with the hash of the Service Policy Id

- *Account NFT:* Can only be minted when subscription fee is paid to Payment Contract and burned when subscriber exits the system. Datum is updated when fees are deposited and withdrawn from Payments Contract.

 - TokenName: Defined in Subscriber Multi-validator parameters with hash of the Subscriber Policy Id
\
== Smart Contracts

=== Payment Multi-validator
\
The Payments Contract is responsible for managing the prepaid subscription fees, validating subscriptions, and ensuring the proper distribution of these fees over the subscription period given the `total_installments`. It facilitates the creation, extension, and cancellation of subscriptions, allowing both subscribers and merchants to interact with the contract in a secure and automated manner. This contract ensures that subscription payments are correctly handled and that any penalties for early cancellation are appropriately enforced.
